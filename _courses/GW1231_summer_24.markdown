<summary><b>Week 0: Optional review</b></summary>

<br>
Some of the most common things that trip people up in this course are more to do with algebra and trig than calculus itself. If you feel at all fuzzy with topics like factoring polynomials, the unit circle, or exponent rules, I would highly recommend doing a little review on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2) either before the course starts or at the beginning of the course. Here are some specific sections from the Algebra II course there that will come up a lot in Math 1231: 

- [Unit 3: Polynomial factorization](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:poly-factor) 
	- Factoring higher degree polynomials
	- Factoring using structure
- [Unit 6: Rational exponents and radicals](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:exp)
	- Rational exponents
	- Properties of exponents (rational exponents)
	- Evaluating exponents & radicals
- [Unit 11: Trigonometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:trig) 
	- Unit circle introduction
	- The Pythagorean identity
	- Trigonometric values of special angles
	- Graphs of sin(x), cos(x), and tan(x)

<br>In addition to the above, you can also get started reading the textbook. The first chapter reviews functions---we'll cover sections 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.
