I've been working my way through Jackson and Moffat's [*An Introduction to Quantum and Vassiliev Knot Invariants*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-05213-3), and as I'm approaching the end of the section on the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants, I want to collect all the details of the construction and the invariance proof in one location. Here we go! 

### Tangles and the Turaev moves

We work with (oriented) *tangles* instead of directly with knots and links, since we'd like a way to split things into basic components (lines, crossings, caps, and cups) that aren't themselves links.

We consider tangles up to ambient isotopy fixing the boundary points, which means working with the usual Reidemeister moves, keeping the endpoints of each strand fixed at the boundary. However, our goal is to obtain invariants by associating morphisms to the following *elementary tangles:* 

<center><img style="max-width: 700px; width:90%" src="/assets/post_photos/9-6-24-elementary-tangles.png" height="auto"></center>

which don't include either kind of crossing with strands pointing either down or to the side. To get around this, we can isotope the strands involved in any such crossing to make the crossing look locally like one with strands pointing up (so looking like either $c$ or $-c$ above). For instance, to deal with a downward pointing positive crossing, we can isotope as shown below: 

<center><img style="max-width: 700px; width:80%" src="/assets/post_photos/9-6-24-t7-motivation.png" height="auto"></center>

We'll be restricting our attention to tangles generated by the above elementary tangles, and to retain the notion of equivalence, we need a new set of moves on diagrams, called *Turaev moves*. One of these moves, will say that the two ways of isotoping the downward crossing above are equivalent. Tangles come with notions of composition (vertical stacking) and tensor product (horizontal stacking), and using these operations to construct new tangles allows us to think of the elementary tangles as a generating set.

The above picture shows tangle composition. Breaking $A$ into elementary tangles, we have 

<center><img style="max-width: 700px; width:90%" src="/assets/post_photos/9-6-24-tangle-decomp.png" height="auto"></center>

And $B = c \otimes -1$, so $A \circ B = (1 \otimes n) \circ (-c \otimes -1) \circ (c \otimes 1)$. Here's a Theorem from Jackson and Moffat's book saying that the (oriented) Turaev moves are enough to describe tangle equivalence:

The plan is to get certain invariants of tangles by picking a finitely generated, free $k$-module $V$ and assigning to each tangle a module morphism with domain and codomain some tensor products of $V$ and $V\dual$. These will be built up by the compositions and tensor products suggested by the tangle diagram, starting with the morphisms assigned to the elementary tangles. Each Turaev move then imposes a condition on what morphisms can be assigned to the elementary tangles, generating a long list of properties the morphisms have to satisfy. Coming up with morphisms that meet all these conditions is difficult, and the work of Reshetikhin and Turaev in the 90s was to show that suitable morphisms can be obtained from representations of a special class of Hopf algebras. 

### Ribbon Hopf algebras

Here's a list of all the conditions we need $(\A, m, \Delta, \eta, \varepsilon, S, R, \v)$ to meet: 

<details markdown = "1">
<summary>1. $(\A, m, \eta)$ needs to be a unital associative algebra</summary>

where $m: \A \otimes \A \to \A$ is the multiplication and  $\eta: k \to \A$ is the unit. This can be expressed as saying 

$$\begin{gather*} m \circ (\id \otimes m) = m \circ (m \otimes \id) \\ m \circ (\eta \otimes \id) = \kappa: k \otimes \A \stackrel{\cong}{\longrightarrow} \A \\ m \circ (\id \otimes \eta) = \kappa': \A \otimes k \stackrel{\cong}{\longrightarrow} \A \end{gather*}$$

</details>

<details markdown = "1">
<summary>2. $(\A, \Delta, \varepsilon)$ needs to be a counital coassociative coalgebra</summary>

where $\Delta: \A \to \A \otimes \A$ is the comultiplication and $\varepsilon: \A \to k$ is the counit. This can be expressed as saying 

$$\begin{gather*} (\id \otimes \Delta) \circ \Delta = (\Delta \otimes \id) \circ \Delta \\ (\varepsilon \otimes \id) \circ \Delta = \kappa\inv \\ (\id \otimes \varepsilon) \circ \Delta = (\kappa')\inv \end{gather*}$$

</details>

<details markdown = "1">
<summary>3. $(\A, m, \Delta, \eta, \varepsilon)$ needs to be a bialgebra</summary>

meaning $\Delta$ and $\varepsilon$ need to be morphisms of algebras. Equivalently, $m$ and $\eta$ need to be morphisms of coalgebras. 

</details>

<details markdown = "1"> 
<summary>4. $(\A, m, \Delta, \eta, \varepsilon, S)$ needs to be a Hopf algebra</summary>

where $S: \A \to \A$ is the antipode, an anti-homomorphism satisfying 

$$m \circ (S \otimes \id) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \varepsilon = m \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta$$

</details>

<details markdown = "1">
<summary>5. $(\A, m, \Delta, \eta, \varepsilon, S, R)$ needs to be a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra</summary> 

so $S$ is a bijection and $R \in \A \otimes \A$ is a universal R-matrix, meaning it is invertible and satisfies 

$$\begin{gather*} (\tau \circ \Delta)(a) = R \cdot \Delta(a) \cdot R\inv \\ (\Delta \otimes \id) (R) = R_{13} \cdot R_{23} \\ (\id \otimes \Delta) (R) = R_{13} \cdot R_{12} \end{gather*}$$ 

where $R = \sum_i \alpha_i \otimes \beta_i$ and we define $R_{12} = \sum_i \alpha_i \otimes \beta_i \otimes 1$, $R_{13} = \sum_i \alpha_i \otimes 1 \otimes \beta_i$, and $R_{23} = \sum_i 1 \otimes \alpha_i \otimes \beta_i$.

</details>

<details markdown = "1"> 
<summary>6. $(\A, m, \Delta, \eta, \varepsilon, S, R, \v)$ needs to be a ribbon Hopf algebra</summary>

where $\v \in \A$ is an element defined in terms of $\u = \sum_i S(\beta_i) \alpha_i$ by requiring the following conditions to be satisfied: 

1. $\v$ is central 
2. $\v^2 = S(\u) \u$
3. $S(\v) = \v$
4. $\varepsilon(\v) = 1_k$
5. $\Delta(\v) = (\tau(R) \cdot R)\inv \cdot (\v \otimes \v)$

This gives us a long list of properties these elements and operations satisfy which correspond in some sense to the properties required of the morphisms we want to associate with the elementary tangles.

### <br>Defining the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants

Once we have a ribbon Hopf algebra $\A$, we can define the associated Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant $Q^\A$ by saying what it does to the elementary tangles. We do this by decorating each component of a tangle with a representation $\rho^V: \A \to \End(V)$ where $V$ is a free module of finite rank. If $V$ has basis {$e_i$} and its dual $V^*$ has basis {$e^i$}, then we can define the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant $Q^\A$ as follows, where $V$ and $W$ are possibly different free modules over $k$:
